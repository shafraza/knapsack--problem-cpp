<h1>Title: Knapsack Problem</h1>

Introduction:
The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science that involves determining the maximum value of items that can be carried in a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the task is to determine the items to include in the knapsack such that the total weight of the items is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack, while maximizing the total value of the items.

<h3>Input:</h3>

A list of items, each with a weight and a value.
The capacity of the knapsack.

<h3>Output:</h3>

The maximum total value of items that can be carried in the knapsack.

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

The weight and value of each item are non-negative integers.
The capacity of the knapsack is a non-negative integer.
The total number of items is less than or equal to 100.

<h2>Example:</h2>

<h3>Input:</h3>
Items = [(w=1, v=6), (w=2, v=10), (w=3, v=12)]
Capacity = 5

<h3>Output:</h3>
Maximum value = 22
Items selected = [(w=1, v=6), (w=2, v=10)]

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
In this example, the capacity of the knapsack is 5. We can select items such that their total weight is 3 and total value is 22, which is the maximum value possible for a knapsack of capacity 5. The selected items are item 1 with weight 1 and value 6, and item 2 with weight 2 and value 10.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The Knapsack problem is a fundamental optimization problem that has a wide range of applications, such as in resource allocation, scheduling, and finance. There exist efficient algorithms such as dynamic programming, which can be used to solve the problem optimally in polynomial time.
